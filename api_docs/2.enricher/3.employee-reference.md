You need a company linkedin_id to perform this request, if you have the company url, perform a company enrichment first to extract the linkedin_id and then make this request.
::

::tip{target="_blank" to="/docs/enricher/company-reference"}
Using the estimated_employee_count gives you a pretty good guess of how many credits it will cost to scrape all the employees at a company.
::

::note
A cursor is provided to you if employee count is greater than the limit provided, send this back in subsequent requests to fetch all employees.
Example: limit is 100, but company has 400 employees, a cursor will be returned in all requests until no more employees left to scrape.
